## Installation

Angular Primitives is split into different packages for each component.
You can install each package separately, and only include the components you need.

For example, should you wish to create an avatar component, you can install the `@ng-primitives/avatar` package:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i @ng-primitives/avatar
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @ng-primitives/avatar
```

</CodeGroup>

## Schematics

Our primitives come with schematics that allow you to quickly scaffold a new component with the recommended setup.
This allows you to quickly get started with a new component, and gives you a good starting point for your own customizations.

The schematics come bundled with each individual package, so you can use them right away after installing a package.

```bash
ng generate @ng-primitives/avatar:avatar
```

We also support Nx workspaces, so you can use the schematics with the `nx generate` command as well.

```bash
nx generate @ng-primitives/avatar:avatar
```

## Versioning

Angular Primitives follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
All packages will be released simultaneously, and will have the same version number.
This means that keeping your packages up to date is easy, and you don't have to worry about compatibility issues.

It is recommended that you keep all `@ng-primitives` packages on the same version number, as some may depend on each other.

As a result of following Semantic Versioning, a breaking change in any of the packages will result in a major version bump for all packages,
even if the breaking change only affects a single package.
